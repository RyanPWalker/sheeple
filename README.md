- Scoring
  - if the chameleon escapes undetected: chameleon - 2pts, everyone else - 0pts
    - preferences option to gain 1pt if you guessed the chameleon correctly
  - if the chameleon is caught, but guesses correctly: chameleon - 1pts, everyone else - 0pts
  - if the chameleon is caught and doesn't guess the secret word: chameleon - 0pts, everyone else - 2pts (preferences option for 1pt)
  - Design for score. I'm thinking to put the score right next to name. Put names around the card in the middle.
- First person to 5 wins! (default, more in host preferences)
